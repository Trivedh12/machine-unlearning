# Machine Unlearning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Machine Unlearning**, which is the process of removing the influence of specific data from a trained machine learning model without retraining it from scratch. The goal is to improve data privacy, comply with regulations, and efficiently update models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of machine unlearning
- Implement unlearning techniques on a trained model
- Evaluate model performance before and after unlearning
- Reduce retraining cost and time

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Machine Learning Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- GitHub (for version control)

## 📂 Project Structure

## ▶ How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Observe model training and unlearning results

## 📊 Output
- Trained machine learning model
- Performance comparison before and after unlearning
- Demonstration of data removal impact

## 📚 Use Case
- Data privacy and compliance (GDPR-like scenarios)
- Model updates without full retraining
- Research and academic learning
